# Movie Trailer
movie-trailer creates a website to display a movie's poster and trailer.

## Usage
To create movies, `media.Movie` takes in 3 arguments: title, poster URL and YouTube trailer URL.

`your_movie1 = media.Movie("Title", "Poster URL", "YouTube URL")`

Then add each instance into the `movies` array.

`movies = [your_movie1, your_movie2]`
